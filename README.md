# The Garden of Cherry

This project is intended to track the catalog of games I have played on stream, as well as filter them on a by year basis to see when they were played. A React app written in JS, it will start simple and slowly become more complicated as time progresses. 

Future Upgrades:
- Dynamically pulling games and the year they were played by the Twitch API
- Creating sub dialog boxes that convey stats about the given game, as well as other links on where to watch more content of mine on the game (likely Youtube, possibly links to the Twitch playlist for the game)
- Ability for visitors to leave feedback or reviews on the playthrough as seen on stream or in Youtube videos
